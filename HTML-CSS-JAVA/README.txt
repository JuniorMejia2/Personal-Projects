In the fall of 2021, I took a course learning HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT. In this repository, you'll find different examples of what I learned in this course. Primarily web development, we ventured off into C# learning Azure Functions and even building data-driven applications. You'll also find full websites showcasing my skills. We used various types of technologies and libraries including, Azure, Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio 2019, JQUERY, Bootstrap, and Bootswatch.
