This is an example of what I learned in my SQL class in the fall of 2021. This was only the beginning of the course where we learned INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, JOINS, CREATE, and EXECUTE clauses. This was only the beginning, as you explore this section, I showcase different problems and solutions varying in different levels of complexity and difficulty. We also learned how to utilize Azure to create these databases using SQL Server Management Systems (SSMS). We had the opportunity to create our own databases, and become proficient in SSMS. As the course goes on, I will continue to update this folder to show my skills in SQL.
