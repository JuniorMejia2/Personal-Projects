Hello there! Welcome to the C# portion of my repository. In this folder, you'll find different projects I completed in class and during my free time. I took this course in the Spring of 2021. Due to covid, the course was not as extensive as it could've been, but I chose the best examples to showcase my skills in C#. During the period, we used Microsoft Visual Studio to complete our projects.
