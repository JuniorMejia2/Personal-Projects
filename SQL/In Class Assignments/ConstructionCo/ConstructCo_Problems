1.  Write a SQL command to retrieve assignment number, assignment date, employee number, employee first name, and employee last name.

        SELECT ASSIGN_NUM, ASSIGN_DATE, EMPLOYEE.EMP_NUM, EMP_FNAME, EMP_LNAME FROM ASSIGNMENT JON EMPLOYEE ON ASSIGNMENT.EMP_NUM=EMPLOYEE.EMP_NUM;

2.  Add database aliases to the previous command and re-run your query.

        SELECT ASSIGN_NUM, ASSIGN_DATE, E.EMP_NUM, EMP_FNAME, EMP_LNAME FROM ASSIGMENT AS A JOIN EMPLOYEE AS E ON A.EMP_NUM=E.EMP_NUM;

3.  Add a where clause to search for emp_num = 117.

        SELECT ASSIGN_NUM, ASSIGN_DATE, E.EMP_NUM, EMP_FNAME, EMP_LNAME
        FROM ASSIGNMENT AS A JOIN EMLOYEE AS E ON A.EMP_NUM=E.EMP_NUM
        WHERE A.EMP_NUM = '117';

4.  Store the above command in a stored procedure. When the stored procedure is run, the user should search for the emp_num.

        CREATE PROCEDURE EMP_NUM @NUM NVARCHAR (3)
        AS
        SELECT ASSIGN_NUM, ASSIGN_DATE, E.EMP_NUM, EMP_FNAME, EMP_LNAME
        FROM ASSIGNMENT AS A JOIN EMLOYEE AS E ON A.EMP_NUM=E.EMP_NUM
        WHERE A.EMP_NUM = @NUM;

5.  Execute stored procedure written in problem 4 and search for emp_num = 103.

        EXEC EMP_NUM @NUM = '103';

6.  Create a stored procedure called ProjValue that shows job code, job description, job charge per hour, project number, project name, and project value where proj_num is like @projnum.

        CREATE PROCEDURE PROJVALUE @PROJNUM NVARCHAR (3)
        AS
        SELECT A.JOB_CODE, A.JOB_DESCRIPTION, JOB_CHG_HOUR, P.PROJ_NUM, PROJ_NAME, PRJ_VALUE
        FROM PROJECT AS P JOIN EMPLOYEE AS E ON P.EMP_NUM=E.E,P_NUM JOIN JOB AS A ON A.JOB_CODE=E.JOB_CODE
        WHERE PROJ_NUM= @PROJNUM;
        
7.  Execute your stored procedure to show the results where project number starts with the number 2.

        EXEC PROJVALUE @PROJNUM= '%2';
